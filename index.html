<h3> Arsenal</h3></p>
<p>
Now i used to HATE this game called arsenal BUT dont judge me its kinda boring tho so any ways lets talk about what made me love the game so much.So it was in the easter update and i was minding my own buissnes by playing those wierd games (Getting the eggs for some reason(i think thats my hobby))So anyway i was playing a random game then my friend told me "PLZ JOIN ME IN ARSENAL PLZZZZZZZZZZZ" so i was like "NO I SAID NO A MILLION TIMES NOOOOOO so then i decided to FINALLY play the game PROPERLY becuase whenever i played it i wasnt that serious so i played it with him and then FINALLY i got the GOLDEN KNIFE(if i get a kill you end the game and get EXTRA B$ which is the Arsenal coins also called as Battle coins/Bucks) so my friend was like"OMG I NEVER GOT THE GOLDEN KNIFE BEFORE"And thats when i got the kill with the knife so that was that until me and my friend where playing on a V.I.P server and so thats when he got his first golden knife and so thats the story and so thats how i loved arsenal and have i mentioned that now i HATE bad buissnes
